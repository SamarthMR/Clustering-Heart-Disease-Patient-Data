Conclusion\n<p>Now that we've tried multiple clustering algorithms, it is necessary to determine if we think any of them will work for clustering our patients. For the k-means algorithm, similar clusters must be produced for each iteration of the algorithm to make sure that the algorithm clusters the signal, not the noise. </p>\n<p>For the sake of the doctors, we also want to have multiple patients in each group so they can compare treatments. We only did some preliminary work to explore the performance of the algorithms, and it is necessary to explore further before making a recommendation. Based on the above analysis, are there any algorithms that you would want to investigate further to group patients? </p>\n<p>Remember that it is important the k-mean algorithm seems stable when running multiple iterations. This means that we would see similar groups of patients showing up in the plots from the different iterations of the algorithm. For the hierarchical clustering, we need a method that puts a balanced number of patients in each group. </p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"67"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add TRUE if the algorithm shows promise, add FALSE if it does not\nexplore_kmeans <- ....\nexplore_hierarch_complete <- ....\nexplore_hierarch_single <- ....","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"ir","display_name":"R","language":"R"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"3.5.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
